# NLP-Applications-2

I was given the following task to complete:

Follow these steps:
● Read the introduction about garden path sentences and study a few of
the examples provided on Wikipedia.
● Create a new Python file called garden.py and save it to your Dropbox
folder for this task.
● Find at least 2 garden path sentences from the web, or think up your own.
● Store the sentences you have identified or created in a list called
gardenpathSentences.

● Add the following sentences to your list:
○ Mary gave the child a Band-Aid.
○ That Jill is never here hurts.
○ The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi.

● Tokenize each sentence in the list, and perform named entity recognition.

● Examine how spaCy has categorised each sentence. Then, use
spacy.explain to look up and print the meaning of entities that you don’t
understand. For example: print(spacy.explain("FAC"))

● At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two entities that you
looked up. For each entity answer the following questions:
○ What was the entity and its explanation that you looked up?
○ Did the entity make sense in terms of the word associated with it?
